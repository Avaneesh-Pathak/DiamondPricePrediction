# Diamond Price Prediction

The Diamond Price Prediction project involves building a machine learning model to predict the price of diamonds based on their quality characteristics. By analyzing the features such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and depth, this project aims to provide accurate price estimations for diamonds. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up and running the Diamond Price Prediction model.

## Introduction

The Diamond Price Prediction project focuses on developing a machine learning model to estimate the price of diamonds based on their quality characteristics. By utilizing a dataset containing diamond attributes and their corresponding prices, the model learns the patterns and relationships between the features and the diamond prices. This allows for accurate predictions of diamond prices for new, unseen diamonds.

## Installation

To install and set up the Diamond Price Prediction project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Avaneesh-Pathak /DiamondPricePrediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd DiamondPricePrediction
   ```
3. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Follow the steps below to use the Diamond Price Prediction model:

1. Ensure that you have activated the Python virtual environment (if applicable).
2. Prepare a new dataset or use the provided dataset of diamonds with their quality characteristics and prices.
3. Modify and customize the model training script `train_model.py` to suit your dataset and requirements.
4. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model on your dataset:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```
5. After training, the model will be saved to disk for later use.
6. Customize the prediction script `predict_price.py` to handle new diamond data and load the trained model.
7. Run the `predict_price.py` script to predict the price of a new diamond:
   ```
   python predict_price.py
   ```
8. The script will prompt for the diamond's quality characteristics (carat weight, cut, color, clarity, depth, etc.).
9. Based on the provided features, the script will predict and display the estimated price of the diamond.

## Model Training

To train the Diamond Price Prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a labeled dataset of diamonds containing quality characteristics and their corresponding prices.
2. Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Modify and customize the model training script `train_model.py` to suit your dataset and preferred machine learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest, etc.).
5. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model on your dataset.
6. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).
7. Adjust the model or experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve its performance if necessary.

## Dataset

The Diamond Price Prediction model requires a dataset of diamonds with their quality characteristics (features) and corresponding prices (labels). If you don't have a dataset, you can utilize publicly available diamond datasets or create your own by collecting and labeling diamond data.

Ensure that your dataset contains a diverse set of diamonds with a wide range of quality characteristics to achieve accurate price predictions.

## Results

The Diamond Price Prediction model provides estimated prices for diamonds based on their quality characteristics. The accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset, the model architecture, and the training process.

When using the model for price prediction, keep in mind that it provides estimations and not exact values. Real-world factors such as market demand, diamond market dynamics, and other external variables may affect the actual prices.
